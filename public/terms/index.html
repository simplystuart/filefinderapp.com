You retain all rights in and to the User Content, and are solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of such User Content. You grant the Company a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based on, distribute, publicly display, and otherwise exploit the User Content in connection with the App and the Company's business.</p>
