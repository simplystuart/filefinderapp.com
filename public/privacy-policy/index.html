    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>File Finder, a Shopify app that organizes users' files, is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This privacy policy outlines the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, and the steps we take to ensure the security of that information.</p>

    </ul>
